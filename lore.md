**Valgroth Emberstone** (142)

Born in the volcanic mountains of Dur Mordr, Valgroth was orphaned following an eruption that killed his parents.
That day, he swore to learn to control fire and flame and set out on an expedition to the known world's libraries in his quest to dominate the element.
His travels would ultimately lead to him joining as paid mercenary for expeditions venturing through mountains, caves, and burning deserts (stopping him short from reading all the world's volumes on fire, though he won't admit this).
What started as a young dwarf's cockiness would bring some success in this respect, earning him a – possible unwarranted – reputation as an authority on everything fire.
Possible, this might have clouded his judgement, and certainly impacted his unwillingness to admit any degree of lack of knowledge.

## Childhood

Valgroth was born in the year **XX** to Murudim and Elsadur Emberstone in Dun Modr, a dwarven stronghold in the mountains of Grimdûr near Khazsrom.
He grew up as the youngest of two brothers, Baradir 14 years his senior.
Murudim worked as a scripe and Elsadur an archivist.
They were both interested in history and lore, a passion they passed on to their children.

Both children showed some promise in magical ability, likely coming through their maternal lineage, though Elsadur herself did not wield magical abilities.
However, their proficiency and attitude varied greatly.
Whereas Valgroth was short-tempered and arrogant, Baradir was more composed and patient.
And whereas Valgroth was partial to fiery power and ever eager to explore the depths of the volcanic caves of Dun Mordr, Baradir was partial to frost and more interested in exploring the mountain heights of Grimdûr, even during winter storms.

While the brother were different, they nevertheless shared a strong bond, fueled in particular by their interest in exploring magical lore.
And while Valgroth became somewhat infamous for his daring exploits, a reputation not entirely positive, Baradir was always there to help when these exploits inevitably angered their fellow citizens.

## Death of Parents

One fateful morning in the year **XX**, while Valgroth was exploring some far-off caves and Baradir was scaling the mountain heights, disaster struck Don Mordr.
Suddenly, an explosion heard miles off shock the mountain, and lava erupted violently from the depths.
On this day, both Murudim and Elsadur were working in the local archives, and while their fellow dwarfs ran to shelter, they stayed behind to save as many scrolls as they could.
This valiant sacrifice, however, would be their ultimate doom, as the lava rised faster than they thought, and they found themselves trapped, killing them both.

When the two brothers returned, both alarmed by the shock and making their way back as fast as they could, much of Dun Mordr was destroyed, and their parents nowhere to be found.
The brothers quickly made their way down and tried to breach the lava with their magic, but neither fiery nor frozen mastery was a match against the mass of lava.

## Travels with Baradir

After this, a grim shadow descended upon the brothers in their grief.
They both felt guilt for their inaptitude when trying to reach the archive to save their parents, and both swore to achieve mastery over their chosen element.
Thus, they set out on a journey through the dwarven cities of Grimdûr to search through their archives for any knowledge to add to their repertoire.
This journey took them through Khazsrom, Brakdûn, and Uldrazhar, before they set their eyes south to travel to other cities of Valmorr, including Elaris, Zornsrim, Thaldarrark, before travelling to the mountains of Uldrazhar, including travels to Zharasrim and Barakund.

During this time, the brothers added much to their magical mastery, but they grew more apart.
Valgroth became ever bolder and full of himself, and started squabbling over frivolous matters, which would ultimately lead him into a duel with an archivist in Barakund that had grown angered with Valgroth's manners in the library.
Unbeknownst to Valgroth, this Baradir had grown clode with this archivist, and when he leared of their upcoming duel he begged Valgroth to forfeit the duel and apologize.
However, Valgroth's pride did not allow him to back down.

## Separation of Brothers

On the day of the duel, Baradir made one final attempt at convincing Valgroth to back down, but again in vain.
Neither could he convince Ysyldir to back down, for her pride was great as well.
He thus asked Ysyldir to be her champion, which she reluctantly agreed to, and thus the two brothers had become duelists.

The figthing was fierce, in a duel that would afterwards be known as a *Song of Ice and Fire*.
Neither side yielded, and yet neither was more powerful than the other and could thus not overcome the opponent's defenses.
Thus the fight was long and hard, and with both contestants at the brink of exhaustion, Baradir called out that this quarrel was pointless and an armistice was called for, which Valgroth accepted.
While the spectators were dissapointed that the duel ended prematurely, they nevertheless saw that both had fought hard and fiercely, and they cheered the two duelists for impressive fight they had put up.
That is, all except for Ysyldir, for her pride could not sustain the defeat she saw, and while the brothers were surrounded by a mass of spectators, she ran off.

Later in the evening, when Baradir went to try to find her and was unable to do so, he grew increasingly uneasy, for he know realized what must have happened, and that she would be unable to live with this injury to her pride.
Frustrated beyond recognition, the usual calm Baradir charged into the tavern where Valgroth was drinking, and cast an aggressive ray of frost at Valgroth.
Valgroth, unprepared for this attack, was thrown back and partially frozen.
Meanwhile, the other patrons of the inn shouted in shock and anger over this development, and charged towards the door after Baradir, who was forced to flee into the night.

The next day, recovered somewhat from the attack, Valgroth was approached by a group of adventures who wanted to avenge him and set out on an expedition to hunt down Baradir, but Valgroth declined, for while his pride was hurt he did not want his brother dead.
Instead, he set out in search of Ysyldir, but was unable to find her, learning she had left town; Valgroth now realized what has happened, and why Baradir had behaved as he had.
Struck by shame for this development, but with pride unable to sustain such self-inspection, Valgroth decided to travel far and wide, continuing his search for knowledge.
