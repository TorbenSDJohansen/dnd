# Siol Alpin

## Setting

The story is set in a fantasy-world inspired by Scottish history & folklore.
Its overarching objective is to unite the Siol Alpin, a family of seven clans.

## Introduction

**TODO**: How do adventures originally meet and why do they end up in Alba?

### The Bar

In the bar []() in [An t-Eilean Sgitheanach](), a group of adventures overhear the brothers [Ruaraidh Dòmhnallach](chars/ruaraidh.md) and [Calum Dòmhnallach](chars/calum.md) discuss a growing dissent between the once united clans of [Siol Alpin]().
In their travels, both being bards, they have been met with a hostility never encountered before in the lands of [Alba]().
Once again united in their home of [Portree](), they discuss what might be the cause and how to remedy the unfortunate situation.

The adventures, drawn to the bards, make their way to their table and asks them what the issue is.
At first reserved, the brothers are moved by the adventurers genuine interest into the growing darkness of the land, and they share their stories of traveling through the lands of [Alba]() as bards, visiting the many clans of the land.

The brothers are both members of the [Clann MacFhionghain](), are used to travel throughout the lands, visiting all seven clans of the [Siol Alpin](), but recently, they have been met with hostility, and [Calum Dòmhnallach](chars/calum.md) was even forced to flee from [Inbhir Nis](), a major town of the Clann Grannd.

While the clans have been at war before, bards have generally always been welcomed by all clans, even during the more dire hostilities.
Further, the clans have always met at [**TODO annual summer meeting at somewhere, where the clans meet to compete**], but now talk is of cancelling the annual contests.

The brothers believe that some dark magic must be behind this unsettling development, and they have agreed to meet with the druid [**NAME**]() tomorrow, to discuss what might be the root cause and whether anything can be done.
Will you join the meeting?

### Meeting [**DRUID**]()

The next morning, the brothers and the adventurer set out to meet [**DRUID**]().
Meeting her, she looks alarmed and as if she has not slept for several days, yet glad to see the brothers.
Explaining how they met the band of adventures the night before, [**DRUID**]() shares how she has been troubled by nightmares of the land withering away and a darkness growing.
However, she has not been able to determine precisely from where; it is as if several sources of evil has awakened all at once, from the northern frost giants to the witches of the dark forest to the east.
She has, however, managed to commune with the land of the Clann Grannd and noticed that the once tranquil [Enchanted Forest]() appears disturbed.
Perhaps this might explain the hostile reception [Calum Dòmhnallach](chars/calum.md) received in [Inbhir Nis]()?

[**DRUID**]() suggests an expedition should set out to investigate the [Enchanted Forest]().
With luck, the evil can be banished and relations with Clann Grannd restored.
