### After setback

With Bromar & Talia dead, our adventurers are forced to flee from Gildmereholt.
Noticing that Rawager is clearly tracked by magic, Urth and Valgroth splits to find a new safe inn, locating to **RÃ¦vens Hvile**, which is near **Den Gyldne Krage**.

As Grundhilda tracks down Rawager & Conrad, Renato comes to the rescue, and they manage to apprehend Grundhilda, who is later hired to be on our side (under a Zone of Truth).
During us questioning her, we learn Silas has been moved to **Eastern Mine**, which has one entry (Grundhilda draws a map for us).
Further, **Helvedes Hunde** has been called as back-up.
New plan is to infiltrate the mine and finish the job.

### Why did Grundhilda change allegiance?

Promised her 1,300 gold and promised to introduce her to **Fia Glass**.
