After exciting the Eastern Mine in **Jernholm** (upon eliminating [Silas Braa](https://github.com/TorbenSDJohansen/dnd/blob/main/quests/monopoly/desc.md)), fleeing into the forests East of the city, Wild Magic trigger gave vision

    Vision of beautiful hat, green lights appearing sickening, dark smoke over a landscape, dead hands crawling in the dirt, skeletons, rotten orc head with glowing green eyes.

Later, in **Talindra**, studies library, but relevant books are missing pages.
Rumours that a group is also searching for the hat and destroying material in the process, as well as torturing and some times killing researchers with knowledge.

Visit university archives, shown below by Doran, where less is missing; does not appear group has been there.
Find a book with a reference to a map, but the map in missing.
Inquire about it from Doran, who introduces to superior Njal (half-elf).
He will show us the map *if* we eliminate the group (Diminionss√∏gerne, 5-6 persons).
