Deal with a dragon with golden scales in western **Halinor**.

- **Location**: Halinor
- **Reward**: Unknown

## Details

This quest was hinted at by a devil whose name we do not know.
We encountered him upon wild magic opening a door into his home, into which Valgroth, Urth, and Conrad went and ate his food, after which the devil believed we owed him something.

Urth ran at this point, and the devil promised (threatened?) to return to give the quest at a later time.

# Return

After exciting the Eastern Mine in **Jernholm** (upon eliminating [Silas Braa](https://github.com/TorbenSDJohansen/dnd/blob/main/quests/monopoly/desc.md)), fleeing into the forests East of the city, fire door opens and a goblin Pi Pilimi working for Alythor Varnix (the devil) shows us in.
Here, we enter into an agreement with Alythor to retrieve a small object from the mountain **Kruvak** in **Vildmarken** (which was formerly a dwarven dig-site).
It is a small, round object

- **Location**: Kruvak, Vildmarken (Vildmarken formerly known as **Vendros** until it fell in year 114 in the second age from a sudden invasion of orcs)
- **Reward**: Power, riches

We all sign a contract (which Andreas sent to us).
