Deal with a dragon with golden scales in western **Halinor**.

- **Location**: Halinor
- **Reward**: Unknown

## Details

This quest was hinted at by a devil whose name we do not know.
We encountered him upon wild magic opening a door into his home, into which Valgroth, Urth, and Conrad went and ate his food, after which the devil believed we owed him something.

Urth ran at this point, and the devil promised (threatened?) to return to give the quest at a later time.
